# PEDAL
Welcome to PEDAl.
Pedal is a space for showcasing amazingly unique bike builds.
Where biker lovers of all kinds can come to admire other peoples builds and post an
article about their own unique build. Whether its a refurbished 90's mtb, a brand new 
carbon gravel bike or a vintage steel road racer, all is welcome. Its a place to encourage tinkering
around with bike parts and sharing your expierience with others. 
Dont settle for an off the shelf bike, experiment.
And check out parts and components from other bike categories to yours, they might inspire something unique
Nothing is too weird!! 
A blog / forum where members can post images and decriptions of their bikes. Anyone can visit the site and scroll through all the bikes for inspiration and advice.
Whether its a custom DIY build with new or repurposed frames and parts, a professional commisioned bike or even an off the shelf bike with a few minor customizations.
Memebers of the site can post their own articles, comment on others and like / vote on builds they love.
Its purpose is to create a community of people to share their ideas, advice and reviews of bike parts,and specific configurations.
It is inclusive of all styles of bikes, from road to bmx, allowing cross over of ideas.
Similar spaces may exist but tend to lean towards very niche areas of bike styles.
This is am MVP(minimum viable product) So more features will be added and exsisting ones improved, after initial fedback.
Enjoy!!

## UX/UI
The UX / UI of PEDAL has been designed to be easy to use and to encourage users to interact with the content. The website is well-organized and the content easy to find. All users can access all posts, click on a post card to expand it and see all the information and images within that post, and see other user's comments on said post. Once a user wants to interact with the content with more features, a simple sign-up process sets up their account. Once logged in they can create, update and delete their article and create, update, and delete their comments. It is designed to be as intuitive as possible.
All the bike posts are also sorted by categories, with clickable links/tags on each post card and post view, directing the user to a list of all the bikes from the same category as the one they clicked. The design process was aided by an agile tool from GitHub, using user stories as well as site owner/admin stories to help create an app that is a pleasure to interact with and manage. The site also features an easily accessible administration panel to manage content and user accounts. 
Logged-in users can create and edit content with ease thanks to the site's intuitive forms. The focus is on the bikes and the content. The site is styled in a simple pretty monochrome scheme with small accents of the brand colour. The other colours used are just for informative purposes, with no bold hero images or banners, and just off-white backgrounds, letting the post images do all the talking. Components have been well-spaced out to avoid a cluttered experience. The use of white buttons with a coloured outline that fills in when interacted with keeps this clean and spacious, but by using the fill colours the buttons are easily identified and separated for their different uses. The Pedal project was designed with the user experience at the forefront, this can be seen with the mobile-first approach, considering the users on a mobile device as a majority target market. The layout changes smoothly across all screen sizes and remains as easy to navigate with very different changes to the structure. The most important part of the UX is probably the navigation of the site, and how intuitive it is. This was achieved by keeping the header/navbar clean with just the most used features left visible and the rest behind a full-width drop-down navigation area and info section. With more navigation links found at the bottom of every page in the footer. 
All pages follow a very similar layout keeping consistency across the site, and the UX a happy one.


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is based around a basic monochrome style, with black and white. While the majority of all pages are made up of an off-white background, with the black header/navigation bar, text and buttons the monochrome theme is established. The only other assthetic colour used is the pop of neon green/yellow. This is a strong contrasting colour and is for this reason used sparingly to have a big impact when used. It is seen in the logo and as a way to highlight certain clickable links. This whole colour scheme is simple but simple by design. As the content of the posts/articles takes up most of the blank space, and is centered on images uplaoded by users, I felt in was important not have an over use of colour, so as not to clash or overcrowd the aestics of the site. Most views the user will see will be either a list of posts with very minimal information under a large image, or a view of a post in detail, which will have 3 large images at the head of a block of text. This simplicity of whate and black allows the post view to take on the theme of the photographs. The other colours used are basic green red and blue colours used to highlight buttons for log-in, log-out, edit, delete or success messages. These are important for intuitive navigation. 

- `#f4f4f4` used for background.
- `rgb(65, 65, 65)` used for text.
- `rgb(190, 190, 8)` used for accent colour.
- `red` used for liked heart.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/f4f4f4-414141-000000-bebe08) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --background: #f4f4f4;
    --background-light: #eeee;
    --accent: rgb(190, 190, 8);
    --grey: rgb(65, 65, 65);
    --liked: red;
}
```

### Typography

I have used Google Fonts to source the two main fonts for accross the site. the size of its library along with the ease of implemtation makes it a great resource.

The main feature font is Agdasima used for titles, headers logo and some links.

>" Agdasima is based on Big Shoulders, a condensed American Gothic sans-serif font family."

- [Agdasima](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Agdasima)


The secondary font used for lighter text and large bodies of text is Roboto.

> "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types."

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

Font Awesome was used throughtout the site for logos and icons. Its extensive library gives many options to add icons with different styles and weights.

## Wireframes


To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, and desktop sizes. Tablet sizes were obviously a big consideration, but the decision was made that the tablet size would be layed out almost identical to the desktop while in landscape and mobile in portrait of narrow tablets. Any small changes needed to the layout could be done on the fly while developing and testing, the need for a set of wireframes for the tablet view was not need in the particular design.

I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Using your defined models (one example below), create an ERD with the relationships identified.

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    category = models.ForeignKey(
        "Category", null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    description = models.TextField()
    has_sizes = models.BooleanField(default=False, null=True, blank=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    rating = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
    image_url = models.URLField(max_length=1024, null=True, blank=True)

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/dylankane/pedal/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Consider adding a basic screenshot of your Projects Board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dylankane/pedal/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Consider adding a screenshot of your Open and Closed Issues.

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://pedal-forum-80408630e3b0.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: pedal).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
